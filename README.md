# MyCardGame
Contains code for a text based game of poker and twentyone 
The game will take turns showing the screen and then clearing it for each player so you have to take turns looking at the screen. 
For 21 it will tell you who has won, but for poker I am still working on it so you have to figure it out by yourself for now, but I will update the post when I have it successfully determining the winner.
The cards are displayed in the form of (cardvalue)(cardsuit) eg KD for the king of diamonds or 3S for the three of spades.
